Schemey is a subset of Scheme language written in Python. It currently includes:

* A Scheme interpreter
* An implementation of a stack-based virtual machine called "Schemey VM"
* A compiler from Scheme to Schemey VM bytecode
* A serializer and deserializer for Schemey VM bytecode

Documentation concerning the usage of Schemey can be found [here](https://algerbrex.github.io/Schemey/), or
in the ``doc/`` directory. The difference is in the way the reStructuredText is displayed between the two. I
recommend using the former.
