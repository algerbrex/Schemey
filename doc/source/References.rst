As said in the home page of this documentation, several ideas here in my code
were directly borrowed from the bobscheme project(See the home page for more details),
along with the research done by the project. Again, I'd like to thank Eli for that.

Many of my other idea are based of off early projects I've done. I've done many months of
research regarding the topic of interpreters/compilers in general, and have applied ideas
learned to this project.

As for an "official" reference regarding my implementation of Scheme, I used [`R5RS`_]
*Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme*.

In addition, the design and implementation of my virtual machine(SchemeyVm), was based off of CPython's
virtual machine(found in ``ceval.c``).
