Documentation
-------------

If your still looking for the documentation of Schemey, your currently in it!

In all seriousness though, This is the "official" documentation for the Schemey project. Feel
free to look around and see what is here.

However, while I've tried to make this documentation as straight forward and easy to understand as
possible, the most detailed documentation is the source code for Schemey itself. As I've said in the
design philosophy of this project(see *What is Schemey?*), I've done my best to make my code simple,
easy to understand, thoroughly documented, and easily approachable, so that it can severe as the
best documentation for Schemey.
